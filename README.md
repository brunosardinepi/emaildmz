## emailDMZ

A tool to mask email addresses by providing an alias (example: alias@emaildmz.com) that forwards emails to real email addresses (example: real@gmail.com), with optional filtering based on source address.

## Motivation

emailDMZ aims to protect users' identities by handing out an @emaildmz.com email address instead of a real email address. Users can apply filters to their alias to block emails based on source address, or change aliases at will. The goal is to hide real email addresses with a simple interface where aliases, forwarding emails, and allowed/blocked source addresses can be setup, with full control in the users' hands.
